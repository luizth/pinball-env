# pinball-env

The Pinball Domain for skill discovery in reinforcement learning.

## Installation

You can download and make the library available in your project using _pip_.

```bash
$ pip install git+https://github.com/luizth/pinball-env.git
```


## Usage

Simple instructions on how to import and instanciate an environment using available configurations.

```python
from pinball_env.pinball import PinballEnv
from pinball_env.pinball_config import available_configs

print(available_configs)  # dict_keys(['pinball_hard_single', 'pinball_simple_single'])

env = PinballEnv(available_configs.sample())
env_simple = PinballEnv(available_configs.get('pinball_simple_single'))
```


## Feature Construction

There are feature constructions approaches included to use for adapting classical RL algorithms to
work with the continous state space data.

### Tile Coding

Provides both generalization and discrimination of the state space. It converts the 4-dimensional
continous state space in a np.array of IHT size. The features are zero (deactivated) except for active
tiles that are 1. This approach is especially useful for working with linear function approximation.

```python
from pinball_env.feature_construction.tile_coder import PinballTileCoder

coder = PinballTileCoder(32, 8, 4096)

state, info = env.reset()
coder.get_state_features(*state)  # returns np.array of size coder.iht_size
```


## Reference

The Pinball Domain was introduced by G. D. Konidaris and A. G. Barto in early skill discovery work [1].

This implementation was adapted from code in PyRL (https://github.com/amarack/python-rl), from Will Dabney and Pierre-Luc Bacon.

You can find more about the Pinball Domain in the Brown University website (http://irl.cs.brown.edu/pinball/).
