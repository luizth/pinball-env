The Pinball Domain for skill discovery in reinforcement learning.

## Reference

The Pinball Domain was introduced by G. D. Konidaris and A. G. Barto in early skill discovery work [1].

This implementation was adapted from code in PyRL (https://github.com/amarack/python-rl), from Will Dabney and Pierre-Luc Bacon.

You can find more about the Pinball Domain in the Brown University website (http://irl.cs.brown.edu/pinball/).
